Dynamic Message Passing (DMP) Algorithm for Independent Cascade Model

When the recovery rate of the SIR model is 100%，the discrete SIR model will degenerate to Independent Cascade model which is the bases of information diffusion modeling. According to Inferring the origin of an epidemic with a dynamic message-passing algorithm, we can simplify their DMP and get the iterative formula for IC model.
